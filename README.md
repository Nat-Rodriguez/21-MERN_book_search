## Description

I have refactored the original RESTful API starter code to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

1. **Implemented Apollo Server for GraphQL Integration**:

   - The Apollo Server was set up to facilitate GraphQL queries and mutations, handling fetching and modifying data, effectively replacing the prior RESTful API. This integration streamlines data operations and enhances flexibility within the application.

2. **Adapted Authentication Middleware for GraphQL Compatibility**:

   - The existing authentication middleware was modified to function within the context of a GraphQL API. This adaptation ensures that authentication checks are effectively performed.

3. **Established Apollo Provider for Server Communication**:
   - An Apollo Provider was created to facilitate streamlined communication between the application's requests and the Apollo Server. This setup ensures efficient data transmission, allowing the application to interact seamlessly with the GraphQL API endpoints, fetching and manipulating data as required.

## Deployment

This application was deployed using Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
